              A Small Group of Drivers Speed Through New York's School Zones
              Unrestrained, Posing Outsized Dangers to Pedestrians

            Last fiscal year, around 3 million drivers sped through school zones
            in New York City, committing nearly 8 million violations. Most only
            sped once or twice, but a small group of drivers committed speeding
            violations over and over again.
            <br /><br />
            In this sample distribution, you can see how different shares of
            drivers contribute to the overall violation tally. For example, 0%
            of drivers accounted for 0% of speeding violations last year, and
            100% of drivers together accounted for all 100% of speeding
            violations. In between those extremes, there's a story about a small
            set of drivers speeding rampantly through New York, and together
            accounting for a significant share of all the city's violations.

          <section class="step ghost"></section>
          <section class="step">
            Even when limiting one's view to the top 50% of drivers, things
            start to look disproportionate. These drivers all sped through
            school zones at least twice last year, and together accounted for
            over 80% of all violations.
          </section>
          <section class="step ghost"></section>
          <section class="step">
            Things get even more extreme when you look at the very top of the
            distribution. The top 1% of drivers - about 30,000 license plates -
            accounted for over a tenth of New York's school zone violations last
            year. All told, they sped through school zones nearly 850,000 times.
            <br /><br />
            Each of these top offenders sped at least 17 times. The worst
            offender sped over 750 times - more than twice a day on average.

          <section class="step ghost"></section>
          <section class="step">
            This small group of top offenders drove mostly around Brooklyn and
            Queens, New York's two most populous boroughs. These boroughs also
            have light traffic, relative to Manhattan at least, which may allow
            for easier speeding.

          <section class="step ghost"></section>
          <section class="step">
            As evidenced by one driver racking up over 750 violations, top
            offenders in New York can speed through school zones as much as they
            please. They pay a $50 fine per violation, but their cars aren't
            taken off the road, no matter how often they're fined. A city
            abatement program used to require some drivers with 15 or more
            school zone violations to take a two-hour safety course, but it
            expired in
            <a

            >
            Even when it was active, it only required 1,600 drivers to take the
            course, out of the tens of thousands eligible. Beyond mandating a
            safety course, the city rarely took other action, only seizing cars
            from 12 top offenders during the few years the abatement program was

            While the city doesn't impose serious consequences on top offenders,
            their driving has deadly consequences for pedestrians. In 2021, a
            driver with over 90 violations sped the wrong way up Gates Avenue in
            Fort Greene, killing a 3-month old
            <a

              >baby.</a
            >
            In 2024, another driver with nearly 30 violations struck and killed
            a pedestrian in

            You can see how some top offenders rampantly speed through the city
            in this map. Unless officials enact policy to prevent this behavior,
            there's every reason to expect speeding patterns like these to
            persist in New York, putting the city's children and pedestrians of
            all kind in danger.

          <div class="footer-title">Methodology</div>
          School zone violation data for the 2024 fiscal year was sourced from
          <a
            href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2024/pvqr-7yc4/about_data"
            >NYC's open data portal</a
          >. Fine amounts were pulled from the portal as well. <br /><br />
          At over 8 million instances, school zone violations are costly to
          store in memory. Violation data was aggregated up to the license plate
          level, and then information about specific violation instances (like a
          violation's street and cross-street) was pulled as needed via the
          <a
            href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/pvqr-7yc4"
            >Socrata Open Data API</a
          >. Those streets/cross-streets were then converted into latitude and
          longitude coordinates using the
          <a

          Since violations are so numerous, they couldn't all be presented
          interactively in this project. A sample of violations from across the
          distribution of offenders is presented instead. But note that all
          statistics displayed in this project - for example the fact that 50%
          of drivers accounted for 80% of violations, or that top offenders
          drove mostly around Brooklyn and Queens - are drawn from the entire
          distribution of data, not just the small representative sample.
