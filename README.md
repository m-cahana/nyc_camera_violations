### New York City School Zone Violations

A look into the distribution of school zone violations in New York City, and the tail-end of drivers
who contribute a significant share of violations despite being relatively small in number. 


This project uses Python for data processing, and D3 and Mapbox for visualization. 

The datasets used in this project are too large to store on GitHub. But you can find the three datasets required for processing and visualization here:
* [Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2024](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2024/pvqr-7yc4/about_data)
* [Parking Violation Codes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/pvqr-7yc4/files/7875fa68-3a29-4825-9dfb-63ef30576f9e?download=true&filename=ParkingViolationCodes_January2020.xlsx)
* [Borough geometry](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm)
